## Tech Stack ⚒️
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is the installer's back-end. Why? It's lightweight, cross-platform, and easily redistributable... ~~and I needed an excuse to learn it~~.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is the installer's front-end, for delivering that Electron experience without the bloat.
- [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) is the game engine for Repurpose, soo the mod is written in its scripting language.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the the [back-end in /src-tauri/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/src), the [front-end in /src/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src), and the [mod content in /src-tauri/renpy/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/renpy)!
