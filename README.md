## Guides & FAQ 😖
- **Q:** Why is an installer needed for a RenPy mod?
  - **A:** Convienence. Most people that play visual novels are probably not looking to manually edit files, and it also provides an easy way to back up original game files and saves. It also provides an easy means of creating a clone of the game with the mod added. You are free to, of course, manually install the [mod files](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/renpy) if you prefer!
- **Q**: 

## Tech Stack ⚒️
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is the installer's back-end. Why? It's lightweight, cross-platform, and easily redistributable... ~~and I needed an excuse to learn it~~.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is the installer's front-end, for delivering that Electron experience without the bloat. This means that **Node** is the package manager used here!
- [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) is the game engine for Repurpose, soo the mod is written in its scripting language.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the the [back-end in /src-tauri/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/src), the [front-end in /src/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src), and the [mod content in /src-tauri/renpy/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/renpy)!
