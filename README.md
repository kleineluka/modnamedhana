# Features 🥹
- Play a fan-made path dedicated to ~~Annoying Girl~~ Hana!
- Multiple ways to engage the path, and different endings for the path.
- New stats to manage! It's not just about building friendship, but also raising Hana's trust and self-esteem.
- New sprites! I wouldn't go as far as to say "new art" because I just played around in Photoshop and I'm no artist..
- Lots of words! ~~word count coming soon..ish..~~
- Unique interactions based on your character (ex. gender)
- Expansion on the original codebase (libraries, GLSL shaders, etc.) to add some immersive effects!
- Open-source and community-driven! You are free to help.. please help..

# Install 🪄
- Coming when the mod is released... please refer to the current status at the top of the page.
- You have two options to install:
  - Installer **(Suggested)**: Automatically create a new game copy with the mod or patch your existing.
  - Manual: Download the mod content and replace/move files yourself. **You will need a method to patch the binary diff in the resource RPA file - this is so I didn't redistribute the entire game.**

# Guides & FAQ 😖
- Walk through coming when the mod is released!

### Writing or Art
.. need help! please reach out :) discord: `kleinezoey`

### Mod Development
- [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) is the game engine for Repurpose, sooo the mod is written in its scripting language. You can find more information on how to mod Repurpose [here](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/blob/main/knowledge/Modding%20Repurpose.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can find the [mod content in /src-tauri/renpy/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/renpy)!

### Installer Development
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is the back-end. Why? It's lightweight, cross-platform, and easily redistributable... ~~and I needed an excuse to learn it~~. It also provides an easy and safe way to patch byte differences in the game's resource file (to add new sprites).
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is the front-end, for delivering an Electron experience without the bloat. This means that **Node** is the (other) package manager used here!

> [!TIP]
> You can find the the [back-end in /src-tauri/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/src) and the [front-end in /src/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src)!

### Bugs, Grammar, and Feedback
