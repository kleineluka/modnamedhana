### Writing or Art
.. need help! please reach out :) discord: `kleinezoey`

### Mod Development
- [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) is the game engine for Repurpose, sooo the **mod is written in its scripting language**.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the [mod content in /src-tauri/renpy/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/renpy)!

### Installer Development
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is the **installer's** back-end. Why? It's lightweight, cross-platform, and easily redistributable... ~~and I needed an excuse to learn it~~.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is the **installer's** front-end, for delivering an Electron experience without the bloat. This means that **Node** is the (other) package manager used here!

> [!TIP]
> You can find the the [back-end in /src-tauri/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src-tauri/src) and the [front-end in /src/](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/tree/main/src).


### Bugs or Feedback
- For now, please either [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/kleineluka/modnamedhana/issues) or reach out to me on Discord at `kleinezoey`!

More information on how to modify the game will be added soon!
